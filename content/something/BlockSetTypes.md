# Sound Type Definitions

EXPERIMENTAL.

Sound Type definitions let you specify a new set of sounds for a new block material.

Sound Type definitions go in the `sound_type` directory in the thing pack.

E.g.
```
/things/examplepack/sound_event/scream.json
```

## Basic structure of the JSON file

```json
{
  "sound_type": "some:sound_type",
  "door_close": "some:sound_event",
  "door_open": "some:sound_event",
  "trapdoor_close": "some:sound_event",
  "trapdoor_open": "some:sound_event",
  "pressure_plate_off": "some:sound_event",
  "pressure_plate_on": "some:sound_event",
  "button_off": "some:sound_event",
  "button_on": "some:sound_event",
  "is_wood": true,
  "hanging_sign_sound_type": "some:sound_type",
  "fence_gate_close": "some:sound_event",
  "fence_gate_open": "some:sound_event"
}
```
